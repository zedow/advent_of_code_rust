# Advent of code

The purpose of this project is to solve every [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzle in Rust ðŸ¦€.
I'm still learning Rust, and it's a great opportunity to improve my skills and learn more about the language.
The idea is to solve the puzzles from each year in this project and add features over time:

-Create a template system to scaffold a puzzle for each day
-Run the solution for a specific day
-Run all solutions
-Benchmark solutions and updating the README to reflect the latest benchmarks
